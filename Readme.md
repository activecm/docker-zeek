[activecm/zeek](https://hub.docker.com/r/activecm/zeek) is meant to run a single-system Zeek cluster inside of a docker container. It is based on, but differs from [blacktop/zeek:zeekctl](https://hub.docker.com/r/blacktop/zeek) in that it focuses on running multiple Zeek processes with `zeekctl`. To that end, there are several helpful features included:

- A [configuration wizard](https://github.com/activecm/zeekcfg) for generating a `node.cfg` cluster configuration
- Will automatically run `zeekctl` on start and print a diagnostic report if it fails
- Cron will periodically ensure that all Zeek processes are running and restart any that have crashed
- Zeek's package manager is included, allowing you to easily install zeek plugins
- Performance improvement by using `ethtool` to disable certain interface features by default
- Performance improvement with AF_Packet plugin installed and enabled by default in the configuration wizard
- Comes with the following other plugins pre-installed
  - bro-interface-setup 
  - bro-doctor 
  - ja3

## Supported Docker Tags

The docker tags correspond with the version of [Zeek](https://zeek.org/get-zeek/) installed in the image. Zeek currently has two release tracks: feature and lts.

* `latest`, `3.2`, `3.2.3`
* `lts`, `3`, `3.0`, `3.0.12`

## Quickstart

You'll first need Docker. If you don't already have it here is a quick and dirty way to install it on Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh -
```

Otherwise, follow the [install instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your operating system.

You can then use the `zeek` script in this repo to quickly get Zeek running. We recommend putting this `zeek` script in your system `PATH`. The rest of this readme will assume this repo's `zeek` script is in the system `PATH`.

```bash
sudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/zeek https://raw.githubusercontent.com/activecm/docker-zeek/master/zeek
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/zeek
```

Then use the script to start Zeek.

```bash
zeek start
```

## Customizing

If the Quickstart section above doesn't fit your needs, you can use the following documentation to customize your install.

### Zeek Files Location

The default location our `zeek` script puts its files on your host is `/opt/zeek/`. You can change this directory by setting the `zeek_top_dir` environment variable. We recommend making this change permanent by creating the file `/etc/profile.d/zeek`. For example, to change the directory to `/usr/local/zeek/`:

```bash
echo "export zeek_top_dir=/usr/local/zeek/" | sudo tee -a /etc/profile.d/zeek.sh
source /etc/profile.d/zeek.sh
```

### Zeek Version

The default version tag is `3.0` which will correspond to the latest release in the 3.0 Zeek release channel. You can customize this with the `zeek_release` environment variable. Set this variable to your desired Docker image tag. For example, to use the latest feature release:

```bash
echo "export zeek_release=latest" | sudo tee -a /etc/profile.d/zeek.sh
source /etc/profile.d/zeek.sh
```

### Install a Plugin

You can install Zeek packages from https://packages.zeek.org/ using the Zeek Package Manager, `zkg`. For example, to install the `hassh` plugin:

```
# Run `zeek start` if you haven't already
docker exec -it zeek zkg install hassh
# Restart Zeek to activate plugin
zeek restart
```

Note: Currently only plugins that don't require compiling can be installed.

### Zeek Scripts and local.zeek

This project will auto-generate a `local.zeek` file. This means that you should _not_ attempt to create or modify this file yourself. Instead, anything that would normally go inside the `local.zeek` file can be put inside one or more `.zeek` files in the `share/zeek/site/autoload` directory. The files there are included in alphabetical order to create the `local.zeek` file. The default `local.zeek` provided by the Zeek project is included for your convenience at `autoload/100-default.zeek` and this file can be safely modified.

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/zeek/share/zeek/site/autoload
sudo mv custom.zeek /opt/zeek/share/zeek/site/autoload/210-custom.zeek
zeek restart
```

### Zeekctl Config

Zeekctl has several config files you may want to modify such as `zeekctl.cfg` or `networks.cfg`. The default files used are [here](https://github.com/activecm/docker-zeek/tree/master/etc). If you want to provide your own, place your custom file in the appropriate place on your host and then restart Zeek. By default this would be in `/opt/zeek/etc/`.

The `zeek` script will automatically prompt and create a `node.cfg` file for you. If you would like to re-run this prompt you can delete the existing `node.cfg` file and restart Zeek. For instance, if your files are in the default location:

```bash
zeek stop
sudo rm /opt/zeek/etc/node.cfg
zeek start
```

### Updating

You can obtain the newest version of the `zeek` script from this repo.

```bash
sudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/zeek https://raw.githubusercontent.com/activecm/docker-zeek/master/zeek
```

You can use the included `zeek` script to pull the most recent Docker image. This will also restart your Zeek instance.

```bash
zeek update
```

### Diagnosing Issues

If Zeek crashes right after starting you can check the log output.

```
docker logs zeek
```

If Zeek is successfully capturing and you want to see if there are any issues:

```
# Container must be running already
docker exec zeek zeekctl doctor
```

## Development

Developer documentation can be found in the [docs](docs/) folder.
